This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

## Initial data import and exploration

Import workflow adjusted from https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/readxl-workflows.html

### Load libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

### Path to data
```{r}
data_path <- "/datasets/work/af-mlai-bio/work/Heat_Stress_Use-case/biochem/CC7+8  biochem for Yutao 05_02_21.xlsx"

```

### Read data and cache CSV snapshot
Note: CSV snapshot makes inspecting the data and problem solving easy to do from the terminal rather than having to have excel open somewhere. 
```{r}
biochem_xl <- read_excel(data_path, col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  write_csv("data/biochem_raw.csv")
```
Hmm. Need to work with multiple sheets.
Define function to read excel sheet and write to csv
```{r}
read_then_csv <- function(sheet, path) {
  path %>%
    read_excel(sheet = sheet) %>% 
    write_csv(paste0("data/biochem-", sheet, ".csv"))
}
```
Map on to individual sheets
```{r}
data_path %>% 
  excel_sheets() %>% 
  set_names() %>% 
  map(read_then_csv, path = data_path)
```
We need to turn all this into a tidy data frame. Columns need to be ID, Room, Cohort, Day, Treatment, ... + biochem. Let's start by using the cheat sheet.
```{r}
biochem <- biochem_xl %>% 
  select(-1:-2) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>%
  t() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename('ID' = 1, 'cohort' = 2, 'room' = 3) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, as.character)
```

Now, get the feature data from each individual biochem sheet
```{r}
names <- data_path %>% excel_sheets() %>% set_names() %>% keep(names(.) != "cheat sheet")
```
```{r}
col_names <- read_excel(path=data_path, sheet=2,range="A1:Y1",col_names=TRUE)
```

```{r}
features <- data_path %>%
  excel_sheets() %>%
  set_names() %>% 
  keep(names(.)!="cheat sheet") %>%
  map_df(~ read_excel(path = data_path, sheet = .x, range =  anchored("A4", c(13, 25)), na='.', col_names=names(col_names)), .id = "feature") %>%
  rename('days' = 'ID') %>%
  pivot_longer()
```
